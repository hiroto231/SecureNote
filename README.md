**Why create an application that creates notes?**
This idea come to fruition after my IPhone was stolen. In the old days before the age of technology, it was commong to keep a journal with a list of phone numbers, 
passwords, emails, addresses, etc. with any and all information for safe keeping. At the time, this was the best way to keep your data safe, but then came the age of cellphones. With the mobile technology skyrocketing, it was soon a normal practice to keep all sensitive data on your mobile device for quick and reliable documenting. This is one of the most unsafe practices as mobile phone theft has become more common but this is where my application shines. SecureNote has the ability to receive a note without displaying the contents and saving it in the database. 

**How does it work?**
SecureNote is a low weight application that serves one purpose. To keep passwords, emails, security questions, etc. safe in the event that your phone is stolen. Simply sign in, select the Add button and enter your information. After you select the Save button the applicaton will create a unique ID and store your information in a cloud based database.
